# Description:
AlarmClock is a simple program to display alerts in Windows.

AlarmClock checks calendar.txt every second to see if a line is equal to the current time and if it finds one, it opens calendar.txt so the user can see it.

You can see it's active by looking on the bottom right of your screen in the notification area.

# Usage:
open AlarmClock.exe and then open the file "calendar.txt" in the same folder.

You can add lines like these:
